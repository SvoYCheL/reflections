When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    In case I use multiple machines with git or there are other people who commit to my repository or I would like to shere my repository with the public or specific people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Manually doing so gives you more control on remote repository update as well as local repository. It may also save you some money if you're using mobile Internet and your repository is heavy.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks create a copy of a repository at GitHub. Clone creates a local copy of a repository. Branch creates another sequence of commits within a repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows you to merge your commit with the most recent remote commit locally and upload merged commit.
