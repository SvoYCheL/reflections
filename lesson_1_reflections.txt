How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It pointed out the differences to me.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It helps to restore older versions of the file in case I need them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you don't create unnecessary versions. Cons: you may forget to create a version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because usually documents are independent but for programming and other cases of Git use the opposite is true.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log you get information about the repository and with git diff you compare two commits with given IDs.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You always have backup and you may always rollback.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'm going to use it for my site.
