What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You let git know that this directory is a new repository. If you don't do so git won't treat this directory as repository which means you won't be able to use git commands for repositories and commit changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory is just the directory where we operate with git repository while staging area is a temporary container to put our commit together.
Staging area is a tool to configure the commit which makes commit much more flexible.
