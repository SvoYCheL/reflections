What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You let git know that this directory is a new repository. If you don't do so git won't treat this directory as repository which means you won't be able to use git commands for repositories and commit changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

Working directory is just the directory where we operate with git repository while staging area is a temporary container to put our commit together.
Staging area is a tool to configure the commit which makes commit much more flexible.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

By putting to the staging area only files related to the change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches help to organize and safely test different builds with different functions of the programme.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Diagrams present the branches and commits in a readable form.
git log --graph [--oneline] [branch_name1 branch_name2...]

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

Merging branches results in combination of changes made in all branches if they don't cause a conflict. Diagram representation helps us to understand what changes will be included in the merge commit.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

Automatic merges are quick and easy but they don't work in some situations while manual merges require some effort but may handle any merge conflict even the most complicated ones.
